# Lessons


1.[Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity](/Algorithms and Complexity/)
------
Overview of the course, introduction to the Big-O notation and why algorithm speed matters.

### Exercises
* Given slow and fast functions, compare their speed.

### Homework
* Given functions, figure out their Big-O complexity.


2.[Linear Data Structures – Lists](/Linear Data Structures - Lists/)
-----
Linked List, how a List(Vector) works and how it differs from a traditional array.

### Exercises
* Implement a [double-linked list](/Linear Data Structures - Lists/exercises/)
