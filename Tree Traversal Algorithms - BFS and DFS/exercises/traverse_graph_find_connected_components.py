"""
The first part of this lab aims to implement the DFS algorithm (Depth-First-Search) to traverse a graph and find its
 connected components (nodes connected to each other either directly,
or through other nodes). The graph nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. The graph comes from the console in the following format:
First line: number of lines n
Next n lines: list of child nodes for the nodes 0 â€¦ n-1 (separated by a space)
Print the connected components in the same format as in the examples below:
