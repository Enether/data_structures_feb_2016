"""
The second part of this lab aims to implement the Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm to find the nearest possible exit from a labyrinth.
We are given a labyrinth. We start from a cell denoted by 's'. We can move left, right, up and down, through empty cells '-'.
 We cannot pass through walls '*'. An exit is found when a cell on a labyrinth side is reached.
For example, consider the labyrinth below. It has size 9 x 7. We start from cell {1, 4}, denoted by 's'.
Ð¢he nearest exit is at the right side, the cell {8, 1}.
The path to the nearest exit consists of 12 moves: URUURRDRRRUR (where 'U' means up, 'R' means right, 'D' means down and 'L' means left).
There are two exits and several other paths to these exits, but the path URUURRDRRRUR is the shortest.
